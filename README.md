## Motivation

I like to write a daily journal entry with my morning coffee to organize my thoughts or just spit out my stream of consciousness, either in my notebook or using Notion on my ipad.

## Why this project was built

I like the idea of creating blog posts that originated from journal entries. It’s a bit vulnerable to post about your raw feelings online and this seems like a fun project to test that out. So you can either use it as a private journal or you can publish entries for public viewing.

## Problems this project solves

There are already online journaling apps online but I wanted something that was more tailored to my stylistic preferences and needs. I like the idea of a journaling app without too many bells and whistles. An app just for writing out your thoughts and feelings. Something as close to a physical journal as possible where you can whip it out and start typing. And if you want, you can publish an entry for public viewing. But not if you don’t want to.

## What I learned

Besides building this project because I wanted to. I also used this as a React/JS refresher as I've been using Flutter/Dart professionally for the past 3 years.
I also wanted to mess around with firebases user auth securety and datase.

Something I learned with art is to not focus on the details too early on. Stay high level and fit big picture items in place before adding detail. that is always a challenge with me because I love styling and making things look good, so it was nice working on important features before putting the 'makeup' on.
